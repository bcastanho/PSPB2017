# PSPB2017
This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in Castanho Silva, B. "The (Non) Impact of the 2015 Paris Terrorist Attacks on Political Attitudes". Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.

The necessary datasets have to be downloaded from their original repositories:

ESS7: http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/download.html?file=ESS7e02_1&y=2014

EB 84.3: https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=6643

The file "reproducible_code_PSPB.rmd" contains code to prepare the data, generate tables of descriptive statistics, and reproduce results from the Regression Discontinuity models.

The .zip file "Mplus" contains outputs for all models run on Mplus (Tables 2,3,6, and 7, and Supplementary Materials). It takes as data four datasets created with "reproducible_code_PSPB.rmd", based on the ESS7 and EB 84.3.
